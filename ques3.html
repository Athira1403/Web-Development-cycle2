<p>Flanked by the Arabian Sea in the West, the towering Western Ghats in the East and networked by 44 interconnected rivers, Kerala is blessed with a unique set of geographical features that have made it one of the most sought after tourist destinations in Asia. A long shoreline with serene beaches, tranquil stretches of emerald backwaters, lush hill stations and exotic wildlife, are just a few of the wonders that await you once you crossover to the other side. And what's more, each of these charming destinations is only a two hour drive from the other - a singular advantage no other place on the planet can offer.

<div class="para" style="background-color:grey">
<p>Kerala is one of India's most progressive states in terms of social welfare and quality of life. The State boasts of one of India's highest literacy rates, highest life expectancy and lowest child mortality rates. The literacy rate for women in Kerala is one of the highest in all of Asia. Enjoying a unique cosmopolitan viewpoint, the people here, at all levels of society, have greater access to services and opportunities - as well as a greater say in their governance.
