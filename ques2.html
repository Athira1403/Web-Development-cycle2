Kovalam means 'A grove of coconut trees and the whole area beyond the shores around Kovalam is filled with the endless sight of coconut trees offering magnificent views while approaching the beach. <br>Kovalam gained importance when Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Travancore, built a palace, the Halcyon Castle on the top of a rock near the beach in the 1930s. <br>Thereafter the place was brought to the public eye by her nephew the Maharaja of Travancore. <br>
After Independence, Kovalam was relatively unknown but it gained popularity in the 1970s when hippies arrived here and changed this fishing village into a tourist destination with their wild parties.<p>
